# ADC_SW_trigger_API
Uses the TIVA Ware API calls to sample the ADC that is software triggered

Also, sends the sampled value to the UART. 

* Main file : ADC_SW_Trigger_API.c : derived from example: https://sites.google.com/site/luiselectronicprojects/tutorials/tiva-tutorials/tiva-adc/internal-temperature-sensor
so if the code doesnt work for you, then go back to that code and then work your way. 

* Comments explain the workings. 
* Works in KEIL - V4.0.74.0.22, and found to be very compiler and IDE sensitive. 
* uC: TM4C123GH6PM
* Board: TM4C123GXL - Tiva LaunchPad
* TivaWare_C_Series-2.1.1.71
